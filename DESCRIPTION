Description: Given single-cell RNA-seq data and true experiment time of
        cells or pseudo-time cell ordering, SEPA provides convenient
        functions for users to assign genes into different gene
        expression patterns such as constant, monotone increasing and
        increasing then decreasing. SEPA then performs GO enrichment
        analysis to analysis the functional roles of genes with same or
        similar patterns.
